                            You take a different route from the trekking route today and walk downwards to Phaplu, your overnight stop. You can also hike up to Chiwong Gompa, which is a must if traveling around autumn since the monastery celebrates Mani Rimdu like no other place.

                            You will drive back to Kathmandu on your final trip day. After reaching the capital, you will have some time on your hand. You can either take a walk on the streets of Kathmandu and soak in the harmony of the chaos or relax in your room.
