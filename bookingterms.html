                        You are required to pay a minimum of 25% of your total trip cost to confirm your reservation at the time of booking. Once we receive the amount, we’ll issue a confirmation invoice. The invoice is proof that you’ve paid the deposit, and also indicates the due amount. The balance payment is due 30 days before the commencement of the trip.
                        <br><br>
                        Once the payment is settled, we’ll issue a trip voucher. A voucher is a contract between us, which will terminate at the end of the trip. The voucher is proof that you’ve paid in full for the trip, and that the trip will be conducted as outlined in the voucher and as detailed in the trip package description.
                        <br><br>
                        You also have the option to pay in full at the time of booking. If you are booking less than 30 days before the commencement (date of arrival at the starting point of the trip) of the trip, you are required to pay in full.

                        Due to the seasonal nature of the travel industry, the prices are subject to variable and seasonal costing. We are a Destination Management Company (DMC), and we compile various aspects like meals, accommodation, transport, experiences, activities, guides, etc for a complete trip. If any one of the suppliers increases their price, this will incur surcharges on the trip cost. Increases in costs will vary on demand, market conditions, peak season, availability, etc, which will be reflected in the trip package cost displayed at the time of the booking.
                        <br><br>
                        You book through us understanding that your trip amount might be subject to sudden seasonal surcharges, of which we’ll notify you as early as possible.
                        <br><br>
                        The prices we offer are sometimes different throughout the year, and the prices on the website may also vary from time to time. Your price will be locked to what the price was during the time of your booking, which is subject to variable costing.

                        We reserve the right to cancel any trip 30 days prior to the start if we fill that the integrity or objective of any trip is in question. If we cancel your trip due to this reason, you’ll receive a full refund of the booking amount.
                        <br><br>
                        You can also ask for the booking to be transferred to a later date. Or you can request a different trip on the same date, with balance costs to be settled on arrival.
                        <br><br>
                        We reserve the right to cancel any trip before departure if the reason is political unrest, rioting, terrorism, natural disasters, or other external events not in our control. In such case, we refund the costs, minus any irrecoverable costs such as hotel/transport cancellation penalties and bank/card fees involved in the transfer.

                        If you are forced to cut the trip short for whatever reason while on the trip, we are not obliged to refund the full/partial cost of your trip package. If you terminate your trip and return early in any circumstances, we will not recognize any cause for complaint about the standard of services provided till then, and we will not be able to offer refunds for the part of your trip which has been prematurely terminated, nor will we be liable for any associated costs that you may incur due to your decision. Based on the circumstances, your travel insurance may offer cover for the premature termination of the trip. Hence, we suggest that any trip you book with us is insured with a travel insurance

                        By purchasing / booking a trip with us, you also agree to comply with all the local rules, regulations, vaccination, and all entry protocols required by the destination country before and during arrival. Failure or refusal in compliance might result in the premature cancellation of the trip and is subject to the cancellation policies and disclaimers mentioned above.
                        <br><br>
                        You are entirely responsible for all medical vaccinations and other similar arrangements including all visa applications and Red-Carpet Journey does not accept any responsibility in the event that these are not fully completed before departure.

                        To be eligible to participate in our trips, you must be covered by a travel insurance plan, which must include the cost of repatriation and helicopter rescue for high-altitude, risky adventures if any. You will need to purchase an insurance policy beforehand that is expected to cover any scenarios which you are expected to face during a trip. You must also carry proof of your travel insurance with you throughout the trip. If you are not able to provide such proof at the start of the trip, you will not be allowed to depart on the trip and will not be entitled to any refund for services not provided.

                        Your insurance will need to cover all emergency relief, rescue, and evacuation plans during extreme cases, especially in trips that lead to remote, extreme, or high-altitude regions. The plan must be able to be enacted without the need for prior approval from your insurance issuer.
                        <br><br>
                        In remote and extreme regions where the climate or participants’ health situation can deteriorate unpredictably unless acted upon swiftly, we reserve the right to make decisions directly, considering the guests’ safety in mind. We shall not be held to account for any expenses incurred during such relief, rescue and evacuation tasks undertaken for the traveler’s safety. It will be totally up to the traveler (you) to coordinate with your insurance provider to cover the liabilities. You also agree that you or your insurance provider will reimburse Red Carpet Journey for any expenses incurred on our side during the enactment of such plans.

                        You must possess a physical, valid passport with appropriate national VISA and travel permits (if any) when traveling to any destination or on any trip with Red Carpet Journey. You must make sure that the passport is valid for at least six months from the end of your trip. Red Carpet Journey will not be held liable if you are denied entry to a country or place due to lacking the proper visa documentation.

                        You must acknowledge that traveling on a Red-Carpet Journey trip requires a certain degree of flexibility in terms of trip schedules, progression of the trip, services arranged, and so on, especially during trips that emphasize experiences over sightseeing or trips that lead to remote areas where the situation changes rapidly.
                        <br><br>
                        Should we see it necessary to amend an itinerary for any reason before or during the trip, we might do so by curtailing, rerouting or replanting the entire itinerary during extreme scenarios. You will be liable to bear any extra costs incurred after amending the pre-existing itinerary brought forth by unforeseen circumstances.
